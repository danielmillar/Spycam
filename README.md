# League of Legends & Teamfight Tactics Spycam

## Important
Please note that the Spycam Bot is more of a proof-of-concept (PoC) rather than a bot that is ready for production use. While the bot functions well in small servers such as friend servers, I would recommend avoiding using it in large communities as I have not extensively tested it with a large number of users being monitored. That being said, you are welcome to try the bot in larger servers and provide feedback on its performance.

Additionally, while the bot's code is functional, it can certainly be improved. I have not spent a lot of time on optimization or other advanced techniques, so there may be areas where the code could be streamlined or improved for better performance. If you are interested in contributing to the project, please feel free to submit pull requests with any optimizations or other improvements you may have.

## About The Project

Spycam Bot is a bot designed to help League of Legends players keep track of their favorite summoners and TFT players. The bot integrates with the Riot API to provide real-time updates on the progress of matches for chosen summoners and TFT players.

With the Spycam Bot, users can receive regular updates on the performance of their favorite players, including details such as outcome, champion, and TFT player placement. These updates are delivered directly to a designated Discord channel, allowing users to stay up-to-date on their favorite players without having to constantly monitor the game themselves.

To use the bot, users simply need to select the summoner/tft player they wish to monitor and the output channel where they want to receive updates. The bot will automatically begin monitoring matches for those players and delivering updates as soon as they are available. It is also suitable for anyone interested in developing a Discord bot or learning how to integrate with the Riot API.
