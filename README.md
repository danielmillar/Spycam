## About The Project

Welcome to our Discord bot for tracking League of Legends summoners and Teamfight Tactics players! Our bot utilizes the Riot API to monitor and provide real-time updates on the matches of your chosen summoners and TFT players. 

With our bot, you can easily stay informed on your friends or rivals' performance in the game without having to constantly check the client. Simply add the bot to your Discord server, invite your friends and set up your summoner names and TFT player names. 

Our bot will send a message to a designated channel every time a new match is detected, providing a brief overview of the match statistics for both League of Legends and TFT. This includes information such as the outcome, the summoner's champion or TFT player's composition, and their performance in the match.

So whether you're a hardcore player or just a casual observer, our bot makes it easy to stay up-to-date on all the action in the world of League of Legends and Teamfight Tactis. Give it a try and take your Discord experience to the next level!
